      "summary": "Inability to grow/retain membership due to competition, content dissatisfaction, pricing, or economic conditions could hurt financials, given fixed content costs.",
      "details": "Netflix's success relies on adding and retaining paying members. Competition from other entertainment options, including piracy, and member churn due to content, pricing, or service issues pose a constant threat. Adverse economic conditions exacerbate this risk.

Unauthorized access to member data triggers legal and regulatory scrutiny, reputational damage, and financial loss. Reliance on third-party services (like AWS) amplifies this risk.
