    "business_description": "Meta Platforms, Inc. is focused on building the future of human connection through technology. The company develops products that help people connect, share, find communities, and grow businesses. Meta's offerings extend from mobile devices and personal computers to virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, augmented reality (AR), and wearables. The company is also heavily investing in artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its platforms and develop immersive experiences.",
    "revenue_model": "Meta generates revenue primarily through selling advertising placements on its Family of Apps (FoA), which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Marketers pay for ads that appear on these platforms, targeting users based on various marketing objectives. The Reality Labs (RL) segment generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content related to VR, MR, and AR technologies.",

It focuses on significant investment in AI that support initiatives that make their platform more social, useful and immersive. The company also prioritizes several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support and infrastructure capacity.",
    "long_term_goals": "Meta aims to build the next computing platform, specifically the metaverse, that will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators through advertising, hardware, and digital goods. This involves long-term investments in virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. The company anticipates that many of these products may only be fully realized in the next decade, and expects the Reality Labs segment to continue operating at a loss for the foreseeable future, dependent on profits from other areas of the business for support."
