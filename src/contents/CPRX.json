      "product_service_name": "FIRDAPSE\u00ae (amifampridine) Tablets 10 mg",
      "summary": "FIRDAPSE\u00ae treats Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults and children ages six and up. It enhances neuromuscular transmission by prolonging nerve cell depolarization.",
      "details": "FIRDAPSE\u00ae is a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker, preventing potassium ions from leaving nerve cells, prolonging depolarization, and enabling more calcium ions to enter. This process facilitates acetylcholine release, which is the neurotransmitter needed for muscle contraction. It addresses muscle weakness in LEMS patients. Catalyst Pathways\u00ae supports patient access, while the company ensures affordability through assistance programs. It also offers no-cost diagnostic testing."

      "details": "FYCOMPA\u00ae is a selective non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist. Studies suggest that AMPA receptor antagonism can lead to reduced overstimulation and anticonvulsant effects, as well as inhibiting seizure generation and spread. Catalyst supports patients using FYCOMPA\u00ae through an Instant Savings Card Program. Eligible commercially insured patients could pay little as $10 for their FYCOMPA\u00ae co-pay (with a max savings of $1,300 per year)."
