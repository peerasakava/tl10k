      "details": "Apple's performance relies heavily on global economic health. Slow growth, inflation, or currency fluctuations can reduce consumer spending and demand for Apple's products. It also can impact suppliers and partners, causing financial instability and supply chain disruptions. These issues can increase credit risks, limit debt issuance, and lower the value of financial instruments, significantly affecting Apple's financial condition and stock price."
